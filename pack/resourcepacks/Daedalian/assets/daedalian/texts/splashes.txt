First take readings to be sure the atmosphere is safe
Yes, it's safe
Science teachers had their hands full
Subatomic waves to the underwater caves
The microscope reveals the scope
We're not worrying about the optics
They're searching for the missing chimp, but they won't find him
...battery acid smell
When poised for a nuclear target...
Messages written in heavenly bodies
Scientists standing by to assure us nothing is wrong have already been found murdered in their laboratories!
... the Twin Quasars of Rock
Bathymetry For Two
We're cops, we're not psychiatrists; We ain't no Sigmund Freud
In a state of quantum uncertainty
We would have sexual intercourse
While at the same time we would not have sexual intercourse
Isotopes
Space walk, it's like a space walk with the corresponding weight loss
Have you seen that naughty boy
Who steals each blade of grass
And replaces it with wires and batteries
How fast is the speed of light?
I heard they had a space program
And of some science fiction writer's imagination
Swirling all around like biology slides
Call the men of science
Betting on the genome of bats
Bill chipped a tooth skywriting far above the planet Earth
Alone in my wormhole
You might be staring at the stars
Hitting golf balls on the moon
Stars in their courses
The moon beams strong on the open shelf
Half a moon
Tell the moon you've seen the serpent
Let the sun shine in my friends
E's eating on a spaceship
We're floating through space...
Our friends live on Mars
Lost in Space
In the spaceship, the silver spaceship
Your old star map
I said the force of 50 million suns
Race to the moon and back again
Silhouette on the moon
A dance with a carcass in space
All the while the planet circles 'round the Sun
Although I'm glad that Louisiana is a place, so I don't have to spin in dark and empty space
Stars are mostly hydrogen
Tell the alien and the chimp
With a headset in outer space
If you swallowed up the planet
You would be a wiser man
Plants take in light from the sun
Where we're falling into space
Into the sky, into the moon
Sun coming down on the traps
From The Big Bang to DNA
Looked in the sky, saw with my eye: the moon was following me
The stars got together and extinguished the moon and sun
Rocket ship
Into outer space
I hide my face in hyperspace
Here is a mind that can see across space
She's not your satellite
Where's our space face?
You'll see my teeth in the stars above
The number of gasps follows the Fibonacci sequence, often reaching as high as 55 or 89 gasps before the animal loses consciousness.
